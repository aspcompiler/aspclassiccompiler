                 Quite possibly you're just a normal person. Either way, you're a social being. You need to get out for a bite
                 to eat occasionally, preferably with folks that are like you.</p>
                 <p>Enter <a href="http://www.nerddinner.com">NerdDinner.com</a>, for all your event planning needs. We're focused on one thing. Organizing the world's
                 nerds and helping them eat in packs. </p>
                 <p>We're free and fun. <a href="/">Find a dinner near you</a>, or <a href="/dinners/create">host a dinner</a>. Be social.</p>
                 <p>We also have blog badges and widgets that you can install on your blog or website so your readers can get 
                 involved in the Nerd Dinner movement. Well, it's not really a movement. Mostly just geeks in a food court, but still.</p>
